#Markdown Count
###Word counter for markdown files
#####Author: Ryan Riley

This program counts all the words in a markdown file, skipping code, block quotes, and has an option to not count the works cited section

To use, place in the same directory as your mardown file and type 'python mdcount.py yourFilename' 

If there is a works cited section that should NOT be counted type 'python mdcount.py yourFilename -c nameOfYourWorksCitedSection'
